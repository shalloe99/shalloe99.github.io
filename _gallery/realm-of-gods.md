This three-panel abstract series interprets Asgard—the celestial dwelling of Norse gods—through gestural abstraction and architectural suggestion. Each canvas presents a different vision where towering structures dissolve into atmospheric color and compositional order coexists with anarchic energy. Together, the works explore the fundamental Norse concept of *innangard* versus *utangard*: the civilized interior versus the wild exterior, suggesting boundaries between them are more permeable than mythology admits.

Each panel employs vertical architectural forms suggesting towers and spires—the "fence" separating orderly *innangard* from chaotic *utangard*. Yet these structures are unstable, their foundations dripping and dissolving, constantly threatened by energetic color fields surrounding them. Blues clash with reds; crisp whites interrupt murky shadows; geometric precision battles organic flow. The triptych creates a panoramic vision of a divine realm in perpetual tension—neither wholly ordered nor completely chaotic, but oscillating between states. The dripping paint and fractured forms hint that chaos perpetually infiltrates order, that even the gods dwell in spaces defined more by tension than triumph.
