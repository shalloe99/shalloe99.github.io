Some people say that life should be "carpe diem", but I would say that choosing to "enjoy" life comfortably at the age when you should be working hard is a chronic suicide.

"I have always had the dream of starting my own business in my heart, but I haven't even taken the first step in reality even though I have been thinking about it for a long time."

"I don't even know when it started. I just want to take it easy every day. "

“As long as we feel happy and happy, why force ourselves to pursue great men?”

I want to say, be a `wild horse` my man and set off at a blistering pace! Please keep in mind that present pleasure is traded for future happiness.
