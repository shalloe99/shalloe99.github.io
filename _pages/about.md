description: Hi there! I'm Zengxiaoran Kang â€” you can call me Shawn. I specialize in creating exceptional digital experiences, with a focus on performance, reusability, and clean, elegant code architecture. Outside of coding, I'm an avid basketball player, hiker, and artist with a deep appreciation for aesthetics. My passion for art led me to win two state-level 2D art competitions in high school, and drawing has remained a fun and rewarding hobby ever since. I'm also enthusiastic about entrepreneurship. I co-founded a startup with friends to build an AI-powered tax preparation tool â€” it hasn't gone viralâ€¦ yet ðŸ˜Š
