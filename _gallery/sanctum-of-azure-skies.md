Rendered in luminous oil pastels, this architectural study captures a Catholic church encountered during travels through Australia. The sacred structure rises against an impossibly vivid cerulean sky, its stone facade bearing the patina of time and faith. The artist's gestural technique transforms solid masonry into a tapestry of light and texture, where each mark becomes an act of reverence.

The work embodies the intersection of earthly devotion and celestial aspiration. The bell tower pierces upward, a stone arrow aimed at the divine, while flanking greenery roots the structure in the living world. Through masterful manipulation of color—from warm ochres of weathered stone to transcendent blues overhead—the piece evokes both the weight of tradition and the lightness of spiritual ascent. This artwork captures European architectural tradition reimagined beneath Southern Hemisphere skies, where ancient prayers find new resonance in unfamiliar light.
