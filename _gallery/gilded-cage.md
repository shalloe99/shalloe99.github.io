This evocative mixed-media collage captures a Japanese Shika deer behind geometric barriers, its gaze both present and distant. Constructed from layered paper circles creating an atmospheric bokeh effect, the work transforms documentary reality into philosophical meditation. The deer—mythologically revered as a forest spirit and messenger of gods—stands diminished yet dignified within its enclosure, its soft organic form contrasting with angular blue barriers that fragment our view.

The piece invokes an allegorical tale: a king, enamored with a deer's grace and freedom, captures it in a cage studded with diamonds and obsidian, assuming the deer appreciates such splendor. The work asks viewers to consider: What stops us from living authentically? The deer becomes a mirror, reflecting our own relationship with freedom and questioning whether we too appreciate our golden cages or yearn for the wilderness beyond. If we release the cage of the mind—the invisible bars of expectation, possession, and control—might we transcend limitation and exist as pure awareness?
