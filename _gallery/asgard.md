In Norse mythology, Asgard is a location associated with gods. These three pieces displayed my abstract imagination of Asgard.

The -gard element in Asgard’s name is a reference to the ancient Germanic concept of the distinction between the innangard and utangard. That which is innangard (“inside the fence”) is orderly, law-abiding, and civilized, while that which is utangard (“beyond the fence”) is chaotic, anarchic, and wild. 


Fact: Asgard is the ultimate model of the innangard, while Jotunheim, the “Homeland of the Giants,” is the epitome of the utangard. -- [Norse Mythology](https://norse-mythology.org/cosmology/the-nine-worlds/asgard/)
