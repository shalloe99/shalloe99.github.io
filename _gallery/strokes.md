Recorded in《南齐书·丘巨源传》：“普唤文士，黄门中书，靡不毕集，摛翰振藻，非为乏人。”

`Calligraphy` emerged as a prized visual art form sharing many of the same tools as painting, namely brush and ink. However in China, unlike in many Western cultures, calligraphy was valued above painting until the `Song dynasty`(960–1127) and was even considered the supreme art form for a time. This elevated status reflects the value of word and language in Chinese culture.
