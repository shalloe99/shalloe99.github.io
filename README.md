## My academic website
## Getting started
The website used the al-folio theme from https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio.
If you want to customize your academic website based on mine, please include me as your reference and follow the installation instructions on the al-folio git repository.

## Executing the program

How to publish website locally

```

How to publish website to github page

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
