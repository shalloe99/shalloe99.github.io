There was once a king, who loved the `cleverness` of a deer. The deer that was able to jump through the forest, ramble under the clear blue sky or thunderous showers. It could see the whole world whenever it wanted. It enjoyed its freedom. However, the King was in love with the deer on a whim and wanted to possess it.
