Executed in vibrant oil pastels, this work captures a tranquil summer afternoon through an architectural lens. The composition dissolves structured forms into a mosaic of warm oranges, fiery reds, and cooling blues—transforming the mundane into the extraordinary. Each geometric window becomes a portal to memory, each facade a meditation on light and shadow.

    Where architecture dreams in color—the intersection of structure and reverie

The interplay of complementary hues creates a visual tension that mirrors afternoon's duality: simultaneously languid and electric, familiar yet fleeting. Through dissolving architectural rigidity into chromatic abstraction, the work invites viewers to experience how light transforms ordinary spaces into realms of contemplation.
