  title={An Analysis on Imbalance Workload Pattern in the Cloud Cluster Trace},
  author={Kang, Z., & Da Silva, D.},
  abstract={Comparing trace publicly released from Google Borg in 2011 and 2019, this research was conducted to observe imbalanced workload patterns that can be described via clustering, anomaly detection, and other data mining methods. Corporates and industries are often overwhelmed by large datasets, while researchers in academics are often confronted with a lack of applicable resources. The trace analysis enables researchers to explore patterns underlined on scheduling workloads in large-scale compute clusters and discover any potential adjustments that may need to increase further efficiency. Inspired by the paper "Borg: The Next Generation" which solely focus on Borg's performance, the goal of this research is to complete documentation assessing the reproducibility of data analysis on Borg traces, analyze workload patterns with multiple data mining technique, and observe characterization and improvements made of new production traces being released by cloud providers, such as Microsoft Azure and Alibaba.},

  title={Data Simulation and Evaluation of Variable Selection Methods using Prediction Performance and Estimation Metrics},
  author={Kang, Z., Adams, B., Hernandez, M., Lawson, J., & Gaynanova, I.},
  abstract={We ran a simulation study with the goal of assessing the performance of four regression methods: forward selection, ridge regression, lasso regression, and principal component regression. We chose to assess the quality of these methods using prediction, estimation, and variable selection metrics. We generated the data under the four standard linear regression assumptions, as well as in four additional situations in which each assumption was violated. We also generated the data under a variety of parameters in order to compare how the methods perform in different situations. We focused on 3 main cases for analysis: 1) The difference between the standard and violated assumptions when the sample size and number of covariates are held constant. 2) The difference between 4 combinations of sample size and number of covariates when the other parameters are held constant and the assumptions are not violated. 3) The different combinations of pairwise covariate correlation and size of coefficients when the sample size and number of covariates was held constant and the assumptions were not violated.},

  title={Automatically Grading Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Tests using Sketch Recognition},
  author={Lara-Garduno, R. A., Guess, B., Mernar, T., Leslie, N., Hammond, T., & Kang, Z.},
  abstract={The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF) is among the most widely used neuropsychological examinations to analyze visual spatial constructional ability and memory skills, but grading the patient’s sketched complex figure is subjective in nature and can be time consuming. With increasing demand for tools to help detect cognitive decline, there is a need to leverage sketch recognition research to assist in detecting fine details within an ROCF’s inherently abstract figure. We present a series of recognition algorithms to detect all 18 official ROCF details using a top-down sub-shape recognition approach. This automated grader transforms a sketch into an undirected graph, identifies and isolates detail sub-shapes, and validates sub-shape neatness via a point-density matrix template matcher. Experimental results from hand-drawn ROCFs confirm that our approach can automatically grade ROCF Tests on the same 18-item sketch detail checklist used by neuro-psychologists with marginal error margin.},
