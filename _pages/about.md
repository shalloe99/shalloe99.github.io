I am going to obtain both B.S. in Computer Science & B.S. in Statistics at [Texas A & M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) in May 2022. Gig 'em! 

I was originally born in a beautiful coastal city in southern China and moved to Houston when I attended high school. 

I posted a series of my [research work](/research/), [projects](/projects/), and [teaching experience](/teaching/) on the site.

I love music and `art` because both can spread a message of inspiration, helping people achieve the betterment of thoughts and life. I have put up some of my best art pieces in the [gallery](/gallery/) and please check it out!
