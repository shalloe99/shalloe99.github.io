The phrase `fresh off the boat (FOB)` are a sometimes-derogatory term used to describe immigrants who have arrived from a foreign nation and have yet to assimilate into the host nation's culture, language, and behavior, but still, continue with their ethnic ideas and practices. When I first arrived in the U.S., I encountered numerous troubles due to cultural conflicts. There was so much pressure ballasting on me, and I felt desperate at a time and created this piece to describe my feeling.
