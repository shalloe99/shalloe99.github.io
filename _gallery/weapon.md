Human beings have probably always killed each other, and the tools they used are evolving as civilization progresses.

Whatever the weaponry of the future, decisions about its development or nondevelopment will be shaped by technological innovation and by cultural attitudes and political, economic, and military institutions as well as dominant perceptions of the international situation.
