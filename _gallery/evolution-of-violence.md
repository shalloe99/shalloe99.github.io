This mixed-media grid presents twelve vignettes chronicling weaponry across civilizations and epochs. Each panel employs distinct visual languages—from Egyptian hieroglyphics and geometric abstraction to realistic rendering and pop-art chromatics—creating a taxonomy of human conflict. The composition deliberately fragments its subject: an Egyptian deity beside medieval armor, ornate patterns neighbor brutalist geometry, Chinese ink painting confronts neon-colored modern firearms.

    Weaponry and warfare—where does it end?
</div>

The stylistic diversity mirrors the universality of its theme: across cultures and centuries, humans have channeled creativity toward ever-more-efficient means of harm. Ancient spears required intimate proximity—killing demanded looking into another's eyes. Modern weapons achieve distance and abstraction, the trigger pull divorced from consequence. The work poses urgent questions: Will future panels depict weapons that remove human decision entirely? Can we redirect martial innovation toward peaceful ends, or is this trajectory irreversible? The answer remains unwritten—a blank panel waiting to be filled.
