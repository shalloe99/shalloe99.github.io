This powerful oil painting captures the ocean in tumultuous motion—waves cresting and colliding beneath ominous skies. The composition divides between darkness and light: on the left, storm clouds gather in midnight blacks; on the right, golden warmth suggests distant shores or breaking dawn. Between these polarities, the sea churns with primal force, its white-capped waves rendered in bold, gestural strokes.

    Islanders' migration and the oceans: From hopes to fears?
</div>

For island communities, the ocean embodies profound duality—simultaneously barrier and bridge, prison and passage, threat and promise. This work explores the psychological landscape of migration: the churning anxiety of leaving familiar shores, the violent uncertainty of crossing, the distant beacon of possibility that may or may not deliver. Each wave might represent a decision, a doubt, a desperate hope. The contrast between dark and light quadrants suggests the binary nature of choice: stay or go, known or unknown, security or opportunity. The work asks: For those who must cross such waters—literally or figuratively—is the ocean a path toward dreams fulfilled, or a realm where hopes are dashed? The answer, like the sea itself, remains in constant, unsettled motion.
