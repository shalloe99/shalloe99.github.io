The screams get their unique and terrifying power from an acoustic property known as “roughness,” which corresponds to how quickly a sound changes in loudness.

The agonized face in the painting is symbolizing the `anxiety` of the human condition, while the spartan figure is symbolizing the strength of `rationality`.

`Cthulhu` is the name of a fictional monster created by author H.P. Lovecraft. The creature is described as a combination of an octopus, a dragon, and a human being, and just looking upon it will drive the viewer insane.

The piece symbolized an anxious man who is about to go insane.
