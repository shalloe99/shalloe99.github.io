We use clustering algorithms and anomaly detection to identify and measure workload distribution patterns. While industry practitioners struggle with large-scale datasets and academic researchers face resource constraints, our research provides systematic methods for exploring workload scheduling patterns in compute clusters. Building on &quot;Borg: The Next Generation,&quot; we extend the analysis with comprehensive documentation for reproducible data analysis. We demonstrate multiple data mining techniques for workload pattern analysis and establish frameworks for characterizing improvements in production traces from major cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Alibaba.                    2021                STAT                                      Transaction Fraud Detection using Random Forest and Logistic Regression Methods                                                                                      Unpublished manuscript,  Dec 2021                                              Abs                                                      PDF                                                                                                                                                      Digital transactions and online banking have led to a dramatic increase in financial fraud worldwide. According to TransUnion, digital fraud attempts in financial services increased by 149% globally in early 2021 compared to 2020, with U.S. fraud attempts rising by 109%. Juniper Research projects that businesses will lose over $200 billion to fraud between 2020 and 2024 across e-commerce, airline ticketing, money transfer, and banking services. As fraudsters become more sophisticated, fraud analytics has become critical for maintaining system integrity and consumer trust. This study addresses transaction fraud in banking by developing and evaluating statistical models that can classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent based on comprehensive feature analysis and pattern recognition.

However, determining insurance premiums involves complex interactions between multiple factors including demographics, health status, lifestyle, and risk assessment. This study develops a predictive modeling framework to estimate insurance charges and identify which factors most influence premium costs. We analyze a comprehensive insurance dataset from &quot;Machine Learning with R&quot; by Brett Lantz using JMP statistical software to examine relationships between individual characteristics and health insurance charges. The research identifies key predictors and their relative importance in premium determination, providing insights for both insurers and policyholders to understand what drives insurance costs.

We evaluate each method using three criteria: prediction accuracy, estimation performance, and variable selection effectiveness. Our data generation follows four fundamental linear regression assumptions, plus four scenarios where we violate each assumption to test robustness. We examine different parameter combinations to compare method performance across various conditions. Our analysis focuses on three main objectives: (1) comparing standard vs. violated assumption scenarios with constant sample size and covariate dimensions, (2) testing four combinations of sample size and covariate count under normal assumptions, and (3) investigating different correlation structures and coefficient distributions with constant sample size and covariate count.                    2020                COMP                                      Employing Ensemble Learning Techniques to Create a Modular and Updatable DeepFake Detection Model                                                                                      Unpublished manuscript,  May 2020                                              Abs                                                      PDF                                                                                                                                                      Since Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) emerged, DeepFake technology has grown exponentially and become a major concern in politics and society. This growth has created many accessible GAN-based generators like ProGAN, StyleGAN, and BigGAN. Most DeepFake detection research uses monolithic Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that try to detect forgeries from any generator with a single model. While this approach offers broad coverage, it often has limitations including reduced training efficiency and lower detection accuracy for specific generator types. We propose a modular approach using ensemble learning techniques. By developing specialized models trained for individual generator outputs, we can leverage generator-specific patterns that monolithic DNNs miss. These dedicated models are then combined through voting mechanisms to capture both general patterns and specific generator details. Our goal is to evaluate whether this modular ensemble system achieves better training efficiency than monolithic DNNs while maintaining or improving detection accuracy across different DeepFake generators.

However, manually grading patients‚Äô sketched figures has challenges including subjective interpretation and time-intensive evaluation. With increasing demand for automated tools to detect cognitive decline and neurological disorders, there‚Äôs a need to use sketch recognition methods to identify details within ROCF‚Äôs abstract geometric figures. We present recognition algorithms designed to detect all 18 official ROCF details using a top-down sub-shape recognition approach. This automated grading system converts hand-drawn sketches into graph representations, identifies and isolates detail sub-shapes, and validates accuracy through point-density matrix template matching. Experimental validation using hand-drawn ROCF samples shows our approach can automatically grade ROCF tests using the same standardized 18-item checklist used by neuropsychologists, achieving minimal errors and providing consistent, objective assessment for clinical applications.

      "content": "This masterful charcoal still life captures the ephemeral dance of light across glass and metal surfaces. Through the deliberate absence of color, the work isolates the fundamental language of illumination‚Äîexploring how light reveals form, creates depth, and transforms mundane objects into subjects of contemplation. The arrangement features an intricate cut-glass vessel whose faceted surfaces fragment and multiply light, creating a crystalline constellation of highlights and shadows, while smooth metallic forms capture distorted impressions and draped fabric introduces organic softness.                    Where light becomes architecture‚Äîa meditation on reflection and refractionWorking exclusively in charcoal allows intimate exploration of value relationships. Each mark becomes intentional: decisive darkness defining metal‚Äôs edge, subtle gradations suggesting glass transparency, soft smudging evoking textile texture. The monochromatic palette strips away distraction, asking viewers to see not objects, but the light that makes objects visible. This is classical realism reimagined‚Äînot merely technical demonstration, but philosophical inquiry revealing the poetry inherent in light‚Äôs interaction with the material world.",

      "url": "/gallery/tempest-of-migration/",
      "content": "This powerful oil painting captures the ocean in tumultuous motion‚Äîwaves cresting and colliding beneath ominous skies. The composition divides between darkness and light: on the left, storm clouds gather in midnight blacks; on the right, golden warmth suggests distant shores or breaking dawn. Between these polarities, the sea churns with primal force, its white-capped waves rendered in bold, gestural strokes.                    Islanders&#39; migration and the oceans: From hopes to fears?For island communities, the ocean embodies profound duality‚Äîsimultaneously barrier and bridge, prison and passage, threat and promise. This work explores the psychological landscape of migration: the churning anxiety of leaving familiar shores, the violent uncertainty of crossing, the distant beacon of possibility that may or may not deliver. Each wave might represent a decision, a doubt, a desperate hope. The contrast between dark and light quadrants suggests the binary nature of choice: stay or go, known or unknown, security or opportunity. The work asks: For those who must cross such waters‚Äîliterally or figuratively‚Äîis the ocean a path toward dreams fulfilled, or a realm where hopes are dashed? The answer, like the sea itself, remains in constant, unsettled motion.",

      "title": "Threshold of Displacement",
      "url": "/gallery/threshold-of-displacement/",
      "content": "In this poignant mixed-media work, a weathered wooden vessel lists precariously in turbulent waters, its red lifeline stretching taut against the impossibility of staying afloat. The boat‚Äîcaught between verdant shores and azure depths‚Äîbecomes a powerful metaphor for the immigrant experience, laden with invisible burdens that threaten to drag it under. The composition‚Äôs textured layers mirror the complexity of cultural transition: above, weathered debris suggests remnants of what was left behind; below, deep blue waters represent both promise and peril.                    Between shores‚Äîwhere hope meets the weight of transformationThe phrase ‚Äúfresh off the boat‚Äù transforms from colloquialism to visual poetry‚Äîthis vessel embodies the precarious position of those suspended between worlds, bearing the ballast of adaptation while seeking the thread that might pull them to safety. Through mixed media combining oil pastels with tactile elements, the work captures not just the visual reality of displacement, but its emotional texture: the roughness of starting over, the fragility of new beginnings, and the courage required to weather the crossing. The lifeline offers no guarantee‚Äîonly the possibility of connection and the hope of reaching solid ground.",

      "title": "Threshold of Madness",
      "url": "/gallery/threshold-of-madness/",
      "content": "This haunting mixed-media composition juxtaposes two archetypal figures: above, a screaming face rendered in anguished distortion‚Äîmouth agape, features melting into abstraction; below, a contemplative masculine form representing the fortress of rational thought. Between them, geometric explosions of color suggest the shattering moment when logic can no longer contain existential terror.                    Scream, humans‚ÄîCthulhu is watching from the deepDrawing from Munch‚Äôs existential anxiety and Lovecraft‚Äôs cosmic horror, the work explores what happens when the mind encounters forces beyond comprehension. The screaming figure has crossed that threshold into madness; the rational figure below maintains his vigil, imposing order through reason and strength. Yet the crystalline shards that fragment the composition reveal this barrier is permeable‚Äîthe work captures Lovecraft‚Äôs moment when the veil lifts and one glimpses existence as vast, indifferent, and utterly beyond human understanding.",

      "url": "/gallery/untamed-ambition/",
      "content": "This dynamic watercolor study captures the intimate moment between cowboy and steed‚Äîa relationship built on mutual respect, controlled power, and shared purpose. The pale horse, bridled and ready, embodies latent energy waiting to be directed. Its companion, rendered in shadow, suggests the duality of human nature: the civilized self alongside the wild spirit yearning to break free.                    Wild, wild the west‚Äîharness the best within yourselfThe composition speaks to a fundamental tension: the comfort of complacency versus the courage required for pursuit. The harnessed horse becomes metaphor for disciplined ambition‚Äînot the wild, directionless gallop, but focused power of intention channeled toward purpose. The bridle represents not oppression but direction; the saddle not burden but readiness. This piece urges the viewer: be a wild horse, yes‚Äîbut one that sets off at a blistering pace toward meaningful horizons. True fulfillment comes not from ease but from the exhilarating pursuit of what we‚Äôre capable of becoming. The question remains: will you stay in the paddock, or will you ride?",
