                <p> I was a camp instructor and taught the course Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for the iD Tech Summer Camp at Rice University. The course content included fundamental supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and a focus on convolutional neural networks. In addition to supervising students and leading games and activities, I tried my best to foster a fun and safe environment while helping students learn new technology and think creatively. I also responded to critical incidents, ensured all students are meeting set curriculum goals, and socialized with families during points of contact.

                <p> <a href="https://asc.tamu.edu/Supplemental-Instruction">Supplementary Instructor</a> </p>
                <p>In the second semester of my first year studying at Texas A & M University, I became a Supplementary Instructor (SI) for ENGR 102 Engineering Lab I - Computation. Each week, I designed a customized worksheet and prepared three SI sessions. My duties mainly centered around integrating course content with active learning skills and consolidating students’ understanding of course contents by using related activities. In addition, I effectively used exception reporting to keep the professor and supervisor informed of students’ performance, and actively advertised SI sessions. During the class, I assisted students to practice basic python concepts, including installation, debug, homework review, and answering consulting emails routinely.

                <p> Back in high school, I led a fellowship for International Students’ group every Sunday and assisted new students in tackling difficulties they faced in their new environments. During the summer of 2017, I preached Bible lessons to elementary school children and prepared activities for children to participate in church-wide programs.
